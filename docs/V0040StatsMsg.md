## Example

```python
from slurmrestapi.models.v0040_stats_msg import V0040StatsMsg

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of V0040StatsMsg from a JSON string
v0040_stats_msg_instance = V0040StatsMsg.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(V0040StatsMsg.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
v0040_stats_msg_dict = v0040_stats_msg_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of V0040StatsMsg from a dict
v0040_stats_msg_from_dict = V0040StatsMsg.from_dict(v0040_stats_msg_dict)
